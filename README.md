# TypeScript Live Checks

An extension providing real time TS checks repository-wide.

## The past

**_Note: Idk how you lived without this extension so far..._**

Imagine you have your TS repo and inside you have an error. While you have the file open the editor is showing you the error, that's good!

but then as soon as you close this file...

everything is fine, the error is still there, you're sure of it, but the editor seems to be fine with that :c

That's just how VSCode's typescript works right now...

## The future

**Imagine you have this extension installed, when you open your TS repo you see this:**

**TS checks that run in real time for your whole repo, not just one file, now you can see all the errors, everywhere**

**Enjoy!**
